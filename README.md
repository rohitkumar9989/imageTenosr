# TensoeImage

## This is a small project which doesn't use the tensorflow moduls for the images conversion and predicting the images

## Features of this projects

Features | Description
------------ | -------------
Faster code | Because the model doesnt us the tensorflow library for the converion of the images and predicting, it becames fast âš¡âš¡
More accuracy | The model makes sure that it doesn't overfit itself ðŸ¥Ž
Provides the best results only | This model only provides the best prediction answers as the code has the part below
Managed Exceptions | The model has been managed with the errors so that it doesn't make the things clutter up ðŸ¥´

### Prerequisites of the project

>The model should be present in a directory with atleast a space of 500 MB

>The model should be given paths according to the documentation

## Errors
>The model has a major problem of the index error

>The model has been well sset with the exceptions sor if came across an error look at it..

# Conclusion:
>This project is for a new change in the deep learning field, Anyone can look at it... âœŒ
